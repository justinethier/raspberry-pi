TODO:

- Check temp sensor, how accurate is it?? May also need to adjust where it is placed
- Change so only update temp if more than .5C difference or so
- Record min/max temps read, and display them
- Save data to DB
  - Redis setup information here:  https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-redis/
- Add UI for reporting
